# DOS2 Cross-Skills Lookup

Interactive skill lookup tool for Divinity Original Sin 2 cross-class abilities. Helps with build planning by showing all skills that require two different skill trees.

## Features

- **Smart Filtering**: Two-tier filter system (primary + secondary) with auto-validation
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for phone use during gaming sessions
- **Visual Design**: Color-coded by skill trees, AP/SP cost icons
- **URL Persistence**: Filter state saved in URL for easy sharing/bookmarking

## Development

### Prerequisites

Uses [devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/) + direnv for reproducible tooling (Node.js, Sass, Python, pre-commit).

### Local Testing

```bash
make start    # SCSS watch + dev server on :8000
make test     # Run test suite (Node.js built-in test runner)
```

### Data Structure

`data/skills.yaml` contains a flat array of skill objects:

```yaml
- name: Fire Infusion
  requirements:
    Summoning: 1
    Pyrokinetic: 1
  wiki_url: https://...
  ability_details:
    ap_cost: 1
    sp_cost: 0
    range: 13m
    cooldown: 3
    effect: >
      Change Incarnate's element to fire...
```

### Filter Logic

- **Primary Filter** (single-select): Must have this skill tree
- **Secondary Filter** (multi-select): Must have at least one of these
- **Dynamic Options**: Secondary options change based on primary selection:
  - `Summoning` → can pair with elementals + Necromancer
  - Elementals → can pair with non-elementals (War/Hunt/Scoundrel/Poly/Necro)
  - Non-elementals → can pair with elementals
- **Exclusion Rules**:
  - Summoning skills hidden when primary is elemental/necro
  - Non-summoning skills hidden when Summoning is in filters

## Deployment
